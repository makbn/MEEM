## How MEEM works?

MEEM stands for Meeting of Events and Evidence on the Map, which integrates two different aspects of data, i.e. evidence and events, in one single frame. The evidence perspective helps to understand what belongs where, while the event perspective describes what happens where. From evidence (data) perspective, information is extracted from different data sources, each of which is visualized to a separate layer on the map. Also, event (process) perspective aims to visualize information from process data stored in different event logs.MEEM will enable companies to easily gain insight into undetectable spatial trends and the relationships between stored data about a location and the events that happened in the same location.
